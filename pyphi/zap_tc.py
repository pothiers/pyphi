    """Change the state of a node or nodes and count state changes.

ZAPTC EXPERIMENT:

Zaptc ("zapticy") attempts to get useful counts of transitions to be
used to create a TPM.  It does this by walking the network
(initialized to a specific state) for a specified number of time
steps. It does this without knowing anything about how a node's state
is affected by its input (no knowledge of the node's mechanism). In
terms of cause-effect, it trades definitive state changes for what
MIGHT happen for a random and unknown mechanism. During the network
walk, the state of a downstream node may change iff one of its
upstream nodes changes state. Downstream state changes are stochastic.

The result of a full zaptc experiment is a table indexed by (in-state,
out-state) with a value of the number of times that state transition
was encountered in the walk. One walk is done for each of the nodes in
the system. At the start of the walk, a random system state is chosen
and the state of the selected node is changed.

The transition table is normalized into a TPM suitable for the rest of
calculation.
